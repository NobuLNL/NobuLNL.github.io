Fushimi Inari Taisha is a shinto shrine in Kyoto Japan. I chose this topic because I have visited the site many times and it is near and dear to my heart. A cultural site in Japan as well as being designated as a [Kanpei Taisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_system_of_ranked_Shinto_shrines) This shrine stands as both a monument of national heritage as well as an educator to the masses of Shinto tradition.

## Original Usage
While it is **not** known when the shrine was originally built it has been expanded upon and remodeled several times throughout history. This shrine has been used since the Heian Period for messengers to relay important information to the God of Japan sitting at the top of the shrine. The patron animal of this shrine is the Fox due to their mythological role in Shintoism as [messengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune).
